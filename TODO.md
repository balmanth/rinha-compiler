# Ideas

- Detect function returning types in order to infer reference types before runtime.
- Convert pure functions with known returning types into literals values.
- Convert ternary conditions with known returning types into literals.
- Remove unnecessary extra contexts (bodies without any new declaration).
- Improve dead-code removal (empty bodies, inner inspection).
- Transform non-optimizable function into optimizable ones.
